# coding_challenge

The supplied `times` data file contains a list of start/end times
for a series of meetings scheduled during one day.

Write a program that reads this file and displays a report of
meetings that conflict with one another.

You may use any programming language you prefer.

Concentrate on writing simple, expressive, tested code that shows
how you like to understand the problem, write tests to describe the
problem, and write code to make the tests pass and solve the problem.

An hour or two should be sufficient.

During your interview, you'll walk us through your solution. If
time allows, we may propose a small extension of the requirements
that we'll code together in pair-programming style.

Have fun!
